# Hello, RDS for SQL Server!

This is the code project for the [Hello, RDS for SQL Server!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-rds-for-sql-server) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon RDS for SQL Server. In this [Hello, Cloud](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/series/hello-cloud) blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

## Our Hello, RDS Project

If you've gone to the movies lately, you're probably familiar with theater seating charts and reserving seats. We'll create a database for theater seating, then query it from a .NET console program to generate a seating chart.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
